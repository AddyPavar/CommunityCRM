# How to contribute
We love to hear ideas from our users!  It's what makes this platform so great and versatile.  If you have an idea to contribute, please take a few moments to share it with us!

The project welcomes, and depends on, contributions from developers and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of ways. A few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

# First Steps
1. Read this whole page "top to bottom."
2. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
3. Introduce yourself in the developer chat at [https://gitter.im/ChurchCRM/CRM](https://gitter.im/ChurchCRM/CRM)
4. Take a look at the [Open Issues](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/issues) page.
  We've made it easy for beginners with the [Good First Bug](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+bug%22) Label - these are issues that should be relatively easy to fix.
